# PowerShell-Scripts
Welcome to my PowerShell Scripts repository! Here, you'll find a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks. Feel free to explore and use them at your own risk.
My primary interest in creating this repo of scripts was to improve Microsoft Secure Scores by implementing registry edits for tasks not yet capable of managing via intune.
